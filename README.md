# Python-API-Challenge

Part I - WeatherPy

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlb and the OpenWeatherMap API.

Part II - VacationPy
 
I used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to create a heat map with all the cities and their corresponding hotels.
